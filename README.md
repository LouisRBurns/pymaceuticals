# Analysis of Clinical Trial Results
### Executive Summary
This is a refactored data analysis homework from the boot camp I was teaching. I changed both the code and the actual exercises to avoid posting any homework solutions. The Python code uses pandas, seaborn, and scipy.stats. 

The exercise was to examine 10 different drug treatments given to 249 mice. I made some comparisons and finished up with a statistical test to check that the most effective treatments were statistically different than the placebo.

The data was given with the exercise.

I have included both the Jupyter Notebook and the Markdown export of it.

I've graded dozens of assignments like this one where I checked for accuracy and style and made numerous comments for improvement.
